Third time out of four train trips from Carlow to Dublin where the seat booking information wasn’t displayed.

This has lead to racist abuse to my partner from the people who had taken the seats and were not reasonable nor accommodating people, they were aggressive people.

Their reasoning if you could call it that was the seat bookings weren’t displayed. This was no fault of ours, we booked our tickets well in advance, had our tickets as proof, this sham is the responsibility of Irish Rail. And to top it off, the Irish Rail ticket person on the train would do nothing about it, was he racist too or just didn’t care?

This is a shocking service that needs rapid over hauling in order to protect the passengers on the trains and keep them safe.

We will have to start using buses now, at least they are safer and have a driver who takes responsibility for his passengers.",17 November 2023,,

Second guy on another occasions had to put his bicycle against the door that closed on him while the train staff saw him trying to get on and this is a regular on the train, luckily because he had his bike against the door they opened back up for him.

Both occasions were not late for the train more like the train was late and as soon as passangers got off they closed the doors not caring about the people trying to get on.",28 March 2023,,
