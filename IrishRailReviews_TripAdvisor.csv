Hotel evenings were at the travelers leisure, with locales to explore or eating in as desired. David’s team took marvelous care of us with lunches, snacks and libations served on our handsome 3 rail car accommodations.

So - only take this train if you don‘t have to go oneway from Belfast to Dublin - or if you want to have stress and accept the risk of having no seat.

,,,,,"County Louth, Ireland",20 contributions,0,Jul 2023 • Family,"This summer has been our opportunity to visit other towns/cities in Ireland for mini-breaks rather than holiday overseas. It’s not likely to happen again because of the frustration caused by Irish Rail. Travelling with older relatives, I pre-booked seats to ensure that we would all be sitting together, would have less walking distance, etc.  The guessing begins at the stations: (1)  On this platform, where might my carriage pull up, give or take? Even the Irish Rail ticket checker wouldn’t hazard a guess.  (2) Which end of the carriage might our seats be? As others have mentioned, walking through a busy carriage with backpacks, or worse, a suitcase because you got on the opposite end of your seats and/or luggage rack, is a nightmare and slows the process for everyone. Even if this info. was available through an app in advance of the trains arrival, it would be helpful. Or by digital screens indicating carriages, seat numbers at either end of the carriage, and which end of the carriage the bathroom and luggage racks are. I understand that carriages do not consistently run in the same direction but in this era of information technology, surely there is a way to communicate better with rail users.And finally, which certainly makes a joke of the whole booking system, (3) the digital panels above seats which show that a seat has been pre-booked are frequently not on. So those without pre-booked seats sit where they want because all seats seem to be free. Along comes the pre-booked ticket holders and it just seems to be “Tough… we were here first and nothing said that I couldn’t sit here.”  Despite the facts that our tickets had our seat numbers and names printed on them.  They refused to move. We told the Irish Rail attendant who walked by, didn’t ask them to move, and was never seen again. Two young gentlemen gave up their pre-booked seats to let our older relatives sit down. This is the third train this summer where the digital panels were turned off. (Different routes) Why bother booking seats if you cannot depend on being able to sit together, or worse still, sit at all. From a health and safety perspective, why are overbooked trains allowed to run when passageways and hallways are blocked by those with no seats?  Good luck getting to a bathroom should you need one. Make the inter-city trains all-ticket so that Irish Rail knows when trains are full and if fewer or extra carriages are needed, and so that passengers know that when they book a seat, they actually get a seat.  On the plus side, we were fortunate that ALL of our train trips departed and arrived on time. But honestly, we will consider travelling with some of the private bus companies instead of Irish Rail in the future.",Written 1 August 2023,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"Newcastle, Ireland",1 contribution,0,Jul 2023 • Family,"My wife, myself and my 6-year-old son were traveling back to Waterford on the 10:15 am train from Dublin Heuston. We booked our seats in the very last carriage so it would be a bit quieter. It was a relaxing and uneventful journey until we were about 15 minutes from Kilkenny.

Around this time, a young man in a tracksuit came through the carriage door from E to F and started screaming ""I don't give a fu*ck, I don't give a fu*ck"" at the top of his voice. At this point, everyone in the carriage was very alarmed. The man was completely out of his mind on drink, drugs or both and continued to scream this very aggressively. He then sat at the top of the carriage and began smashing his fists against the table as hard as he could while screaming loudly and making high-pitched animal-like noises.

At this point, the woman sitting closest to him, about two rows back, became very frightened, grabbed her stuff and quickly moved down to the back of the train.

As we were in the last carriage, the only way to get away from this guy was to walk past him and the ones that chose to do so (including a woman and a child) received a sickening torrent of verbal abuse of a sexual nature.

He then got up and started to make his way down the aisle to where we were sitting. We didn't look at him or make eye contact in the hope he would just keep walking. But he didn't, he stopped and racially abused my wife, who is Thai.

At this point, the man sensed that I was about to get up and defend us so he made his way to the very back of the train where he waited and exited at Kilkenny.

Irish Rail needs to observe each and every passenger that boards the train to determine whether or not they are safe to travel with the other passengers onboard.

Unfortunately, this isn't the first racist abuse we have encountered in this country and I very much doubt it will be the last, but this particular incident has left my wife and child terrified and I don't think I'll ever be able to relax onboard a train in this country again. In fact, I don't think Irish Rail is a safe way to travel and we will most likely be bussing it from now on.",Written 29 July 2023,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The train left the station, and the conductor said “Sorry, but no catering available, we’re working on that “.
When he walked through the car, stamping tickets, I asked him if there was at least bottled water, as I had none - and the trip was 3 hrs duration. Again, “ no, sorry - no water”.
That is inexcusable. Bottles of water in the small kitchen in that car should not be too much to ask for.
Granted, the seats are comfortable, but not worth the 10 extra from coach to first.p in my opinion.
If you decide the large seats are worth it, come prepared with your own water and snacks. And get your coffee before you board!

However, my travelling companion and I were travelling with a large suitcase each and a back pack.  It would have been very helpful, to know in advance, which end of the car had the luggage storage.  When we got on we found out the luggage racks were at the opposite end of the car, but other people boarding were right behind us so we had to proceed.  The aisle was way too narrow to pull the suitcases on their wheels, so had to turn them sideways and drag the entire length of the car.  There was a boarding door right at the luggage rack, so if there was a way to indicate this, prior to departure, it would have been very helpful.  We had reserved seats, but others were already sitting in our seats by the time we got to them.  They had to remove the meal they'd set out, so that we could sit in our seats.  The young lady with the beverage cart came by and only served the opposite side, to us, in the car.  it took forever for her to come back and serve our side of the car.  We saw freshly brewed coffee on the menu and ordered two.  This was the worst coffee ever!  It was not fresh brewed, it was instant and came in a cup that had a mesh screen to prevent the undisolved grounds from being drank.  At a cost of €3.70, don't waste your money.

,,,,,"Milan, MI",38 contributions,0,Jun 2023 • Solo,"I took the train from Westport on the Atlantic to Dublin on the Irish sea, a trip of 3.5 hours. The coach was modern, seating comfortable, the WiFi working, and the route speedy. But the train lacked any storage for bags other than an overhead rack inappropriate for large, heavy suitcases. I had no seatmate so I could prop my bag next to me. But the biggest issue is the lack of toilets on a fairly long trip. I've read that some Irish trains have them but this one did not. Fortunately, I didn't need one but what would I have done if I did? The ride would have been extremely uncomfortable. The ticket was very cheap but maybe charging more and better outfitting trains for passengers would be a good idea.",Written 23 June 2023,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,5 contributions,,2,Apr 2023 • Solo,"If there is one thing in this life I despise more than Neven Maguire…it is travelling on a hot day. Be it a flight abroad, a car journey into town to buy some mushrooms, or just a simple bike ride to the local pub, hot weather and travel is never good. So this morning when I woke up and caught the whiff of sun peaking through the blinds, needless to say I was ecstatic, but feeling trepidations at the prospect of a train journey on this fine day. I wouldn’t even describe it as a hot day, but boy oh boy was my journey by far the worst of all ‘hot day journeys’ I’ve ever had. I started the morning with some tasty spar own bran weetabix and a steaming hot cup of Barry’s tea. It was perfection. Then feeling intellectual I tore into UCC for a few lectures. I don’t go to college there, but that is just a formality. Having polished off the mornings classes I was flying high, and even more excited to be leaving Cork on route to Gods home away from home, Knock, to catch a ride to Wales, as you do. Now although they say it’s not about the destination but the journey you take, when I tell you I couldn’t care less about the journey, I just wanted to be at my destination. Regardless of that, I hailed for a taxi and a dashing man of average build who clearly left his toupee at home gathered me up and promptly brought me to the station. Little did I know this was the beginning of the end. If the mere fact of being out and about at the ungodly hour of 4pm wasn’t enough, there was a que for the train. Whatever, I had prepped myself for a sticky and underwhelming ‘hot day journey’. After enduring what can only be described as penance, I then found myself in Limerick junction of all places. Not to be confused as a junction in Limerick however, as Limerick junction is in fact in Tipperary. Well I was fuming. We all know the fundamentals of having a comprehensive set of rules to abide by in life to keep ones sanity, well my rule number 1…stay away from Tipperary. The word disgust doesn’t even scratch the surface as to my emotional state in that moment. Moving swiftly onto my number 2 rule, what happens in Spain, stays in Spain. Well what do you know…after making my formal entrance down the stairs of the station bridge I am greeted by the overwhelming and often startling presence of over 50 Spaniards. Quite frankly the place was littered with them. Now don’t get me wrong I have a passion for Spaniards, lord knows I have enough pictures of Antonio Banderas in my house, but without so much as a drink in my hand and my feet on Spanish soil, Spaniards are nothing but people sent to mock me with their flawless tan and lack of blemishes. I simply couldn’t cope. The wait for the train was longer than waiting for a pot noodle to cook on a windy day. Furthermore,  now that I can relax in the comfort of my humble abode and contemplate the days events, I realise that actually the train was also disgusting as well as the hour delay, and most importantly it would have been just as bad on a cold day.",Written 6 April 2023,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Always helpful.   And always smiling.    One of the trains was very crowded - people standing - but I had booked my seat in advance and had no issues.The trains have been comfortable and for the most part the toilets have been clean.  The only downside is that there aren't any catering facilities on the trains leaving Limerick, particularly the early morning ones.

,,,,,1 contribution,,0,Aug 2022,"Compared to our usual train journeys in the UK, our various trips with Irish Rail over the last few months have been brilliant.

The cost of each trip has been a fraction of the cost of a comparable ticket in the UK (on occasions as low as 10% of the cost!). The seat reservations worked well for us, and all of our trips have been very punctual.

All services would definitely benefit from bringing back the catering services, and ideally some sections of the line could be upgraded to allow the trains to run faster than the 80kph that we seemed to be trundling along at for some extended periods of time.

Altogether great value for money though, and a properly priced public transport service unlike the operators in the UK who seem to be out to fleece you for every penny you have!

Rang 'Customer Service' two days before departure. Lady also was surprised I couldn't reserve seats but assured: 'don't worry, there appears to be plenty of seats available. It's not that busy.'

Upon arrival at Heuston the mystery was solved. There was no train service between Dublin and Portarlington at that time ... we'd have to go by bus.

My wife gets travel sick on buses. That's why we booked to go by train!!! Yet we""d arranged to meet our daughter in Galway that morning and, as the later rail service (train all the way) was booked out at that point, we were left with no option.

The angry little man checking tickets barked at an elderly couple in front of us that the matter had been ' advertised on the website and the media well in advance'.

Pity nobody told the Customer Service lady ... or us. First inkling we and our fellow passengers had was when we saw the word 'bus' in brackets on the notice board that morning in Heuston.

Turns out, the 8.0 service the previous Sunday was affected in exactly the same way. Funny that Irish Rail's own staff found no issue when they checked my booking for me on Friday!

Had we known, we'd have driven to Portarlington and met the train there.

As pensioners, we were travelling for free. Yet the majority of other passengers codded into making this journey might have appreciated the opportunity to book. a journey by bus for half the price.

They almost double the prices when paying in cash because they know more than likely you have no other choice but to board now.

Student prices are an absolute disgrace. For a return 1 hour trip online it is 18 euro. For a student, I'm paying an hourly wage to take the train. 9 euro an hour!

You wonder why other people my age risk it with Child's tickets? Although If you're ever going to Hueston they love giving those 16 year old's those 100 euro fines for buying Child's tickets so beware.

So to top off this review:
- Cash fares need to be stated online
- Student fares are disgustingly too expensive
- Stop trying to bankrupt 16 year old children who just want to enjoy themselves in Dublin for the day.

,,,,,1 contribution,,0,Feb 2020 • Solo,"I use the Irish rail running from Galway to limerick twice daily and I have to admit that it is a great service and the prices are great in comparison to the bus. But what I don’t understand is how the 18:05 train leaving limerick sits in Ennis for 25-30 minutes making the journey longer than necessary. It arrives in Ennis at 18:45 and it then sits and waits for the Galway to limerick train to pass in ennis station, usually leaving around 19:15. This happens in both directions. Surely Irish rail can find a way to avoid this and engineer some by pass locations along the line that would make the routes more efficient for commuters and it would make the journey times shorter. Problems like this do not occur on the lines running to Dublin and if railway lines could become more efficient along the west coast than im sure the train would grow in popularity.",Written 4 February 2020,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

For the sum of €1600 a year you can have late trains every sigle day of the week no matter what time you travel.

The best part is that, if you send a complaint to them, you will be getting a response from incompetent senior management telling you that they use the service themselves and it is great..... According to them of course. They have 2 sets of rairs and they do nothing to improve their service. No investments no nothing. I have been forced to use their service for the last 15 years and it just get more expensive and less reliable. They have no concept of what great customer experience is. The national transport authority which is in charge of this service is a complete shambles and its board should be sacked on the spot or, if they had a bit of decency, they should all resigned. The best part is that they don't even know what punctuality is because, according to their senior management, any trains that arrives to destination with no more than 10 minutes delay is considered arriving on time.

,,,,,1 contribution,,3,Oct 2019 • Solo,"I'm writing this while I am currently less than half way through the Dublin to Sligo train journey and dreading the next 2 hours.
Irish rail can provide good journeys that is when they actually provide a proper train! I have travelled to Sligo and Galway recently on trains that were warm and comfortable. I was actuallylooking forward to catching up on some work on my laptop.
My heart utterly sank when I arrived at the platform in Dublin to be greeted with a Dart vehicle. DART stands for Dublin Area Rapid Transport. The clue is in the name. These vehicles are designed for short city commutes not a journey taking over 3 hours.
There is no heat. The doors of every carriage open at each stop and we are blasted with cold October air. There is supposedly WiFi but it doesn't work. There is very little space to sit comfortably never mind work. Books or laptops have to be balance on one's knees as the small table is to narrow and far away. That said I am lucky to have a seat as the carriage is full of people standing.

38 euro for this ordeal. Irish Rail gives no indication on their timetables or website that this is the vehicle they would be using. They also charge the same amount for an experience and service that is light years away from their new proper long distance trains - it seems to be a lottery what you get.
I try to travel by train to be more environmentally friendly but I'm not risking putting myself through a similar journey ever again.
I can only conclude Irish Rail has utter contempt for their clients.",Written 11 October 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,Ireland,39 contributions,4,Oct 2019 • Business,"I am a regular travellee on an Irish Rail Intercity train commuting from a rural station about 60km from Dublin Heuston. There is a fight for seats every morning at my station and those who don't get seats have to stand all the way to Heuston for at least an hour. People also get on at other stations on the way which means people are crush loaded for much of the journey. The food trolley operator pushes the fodder cart through crowds of people standing regardless. There are delays nearly every day for various reasons. Somebody faints in the crush and often an ambulance is needed and a delay of 30 minutes or more ensues. If this happens on another commuter train on the same route it also causes a delay. Then there is the ""mechanical fault"" or ""signal"" fault"" excuse which seems to happen at least once a week. I am regularly more than 30 minutes late for work in the mornings and my boss is not impressed. However Irish Rail always makes some excuse to avoid compensating passengers for delays. The evening trains are equally overcrowded with regular arguments over people werefusing to move out of booked seats where the names of passengers have not appeared. Passengers have to push through and step over people sitting on the floor to get to the train door to get out at their station. Irish Rail makes constant pseudo-apologies for no extra carriages being available until at least 2022 (meaning 2027 or later) so we have to put up with it. They still charge thousands of euro for annual tickets.

,,,,,1 contribution,,2,Sep 2019 • Friends,"My recent travels with Irish Rail Tours couldn’t have been more enjoyable.

The day after the three of us arrived in Dublin, away we went to the Ring of Kerry with Rail Tours. It was picturesque and wonderful.

The next day, our tour guide Paddy accompanied our little group to Kilkenny and Waterford. Funny, informed and kind, Paddy was ever the attentive escort.

Then it was off to Galway with tour guide Andy. We saw Bunratty Castle, the Cliffs of Moher, the Black Fort and heard songs along the way. Andy was an amazing guide, full of life, kind, very funny and a great story teller.

We had a marvelous excursion to Belfast with tour guide Terrence a couple of days later. We made a day of visiting Carrick-a-Rede and the Giant’s Causeway. During the trip from Dublin to Belfast, Terrence gave us a great overview of the itinerary. He explained the history of the region and made sensible the complex politics of Northern Ireland and the Republic.

The bus drivers deserve a special mention. Jerry, Mike and others whose names I can’t remember were masters of those enormous buses, maneuvering over hill and dale.

Irish Rail Tours was fantastic, all our itineraries, some of them quite complicated, were well organized and made effortless for us. Every step of the way we were looked after.

It all made our vacation a pleasure. Thank you Irish Rail Tours!",Written 14 September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"Dublin, Ireland",167 contributions,1,Sep 2019,"I don't travel by train often, and the last time I went from Dublin to Belfast was several years ago.  Last time, I treated myself to a First Class Seat, with a great breakfast, and free paper, so I was looking forward to my trip.  I checked the prices online, and € 15.99 seemed reasonable for a standard seat.  On the morning of my trip, I arrived at the station (Drogheda), and I was charged € 30.00 because I had not booked online, thought nothing on the website warned me about this.  The ticket lady was having an animated private conversation on her phone, which she continued right through our transaction, and when I queried the price difference she entirely, completely ignored me - literally - it was as if I never asked her the question.  She just kept talking to her friend and waved a hand in the direction of the credit card reader.A few minutes later, the Enterprise arrived, and it was clean and modern, as I had remembered.  Not having a First Class ticket this time, I made my way straight to the dining car.  The lady behind the counter couldn't find a menu but eventually a dirty, stained menu was found, and I cheerfully said ""I'll treat myself to the full breakfast.""   No reaction, absolutely ignored again.  She grunted at me to sit down.  A few minutes later, another grunted ""Full breakfast"" told me my food was ready.  Innocently, I kind of assumed this would be table service, but no.  I was handed a paper bag, with a lidded plastic container containing a fried egg, a cheap sausage, a rubbery rasher, a round of something vaguely resembling black pudding, and a soggy potato cake.  A slice of hard toast was thrown into the bag.  There was no plate, and no proper cutlery, just the flimsiest plastic knife and fork I have ever seen.  The knife was so flimsy, and the rasher so tough, that I had to eat it with my fingers.  The toast was like cardboard, and the coffee (extra charge, and in a single use cup), was like dishwater.Quite possibly the worst ""full breakfast"" I have ever paid for, and to make matters worse, when I got to Belfast I noticed that a FAR better breakfast was on sale in the train station for £ 4.50, less than half what I paid.Zero marks to Irish Rail, for the rip off prices of the ticket, the grumpy and disinterested staff at Drogheda and on the train, the woeful breakfast, the rip off price of the food, and the amount of single use plastic used.Next time I'll take the bus.",Written 5 September 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,2 contributions,,4,Jun 2019 • Couples,"we took the train from Connolly Station, Dublin to Skerries yesterday. As always in Connolly, trains sit in the station for long periods after passengers get off, with their diesel engines running. This produces thick smoke in the roofed station building where passengers wait, as well as loud noise, so that one can't hear the public announcements. I had to  walk to the very end of the platform to escape the worst of the smoke, and was still coughing. Diesel smoke is a well-known serious health hazard. Just turn the engines off once the train is stationary. There's no smoking allowed anywhere in the station, and then everyone is forced to sit in a cloud of diesel smoke. Similar situation at Heuston Station and Pearse, though in the latter at least trains don't sit around for ages.",Written 24 June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I sent an email to Irishrail, and got no reply. I then utilized the q&a section on this forum for assistance.

We took the train from Heuston Station, Dublin into Galway. The train station and finding our train was easy to figure out. It was a comfortable ride and (for us ) preferable to a bus ride.
I purchased (2) one way tickets with the option to reserve seats, with our name listed. Please note..... tickets to board HAD to be printed out at the station. (Don't forget to bring your confirm/reservation information. I printed the confirmation page and the instructions on obtaining the actual train ticket from home, prior to our trip).
Give yourself some extra time at the station to do so.
.
Locating our seat was easy. Plenty of room for 2 large suitcases at the front of our car.
The train became pretty crowded along the way. Some folks found that their sears were occupied and had to ask the party to move. Those folks who had to move did so amicably.
Food/drink cart came through a few times for purchases. Unlike the USA, no train personnel came through our car collecting tickets.

IRISHRAIL was a real bargain compared to the mass transit prices back in NY.!",Written 16 June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,3 contributions,,2,May 2019 • Friends,"Most embarrassing experience on a train from Dublin to galway recently during my stags! Was going with a group and we all decided to pre book tickets so we could reserve seats together and it was my first time using the online service. When booking online I booked tickets for myself and my partner or so I thought, unfortunately I somehow booked 1 return ticket and 1 reserved seat. When I got there to the station I printed the two tickets went through the gates with no trouble at all and myself and the group sat into our seats, not once did I feel the urge to check the ticket as my partner checked the seats on his ticket so I just placed mine into the wallet. During the journey a ticket inspector checked our tickets and he told me that my ticket wasnt a ticket but just a reserved seat he then asked me to go to the back of the train to talk, thankfully I wasnt fined and he let me purchase a ticket off him there and then. My only complaint is how can someone not be warned on the website that they were purchasing a reserved seat and not an actual ticket and then if that fails how can you get through the gates with out ease and only then be made aware of it on the train. Now I know people have free travel and only have to purchase the reserved seat, and believe me I seen that as an option on the website but I clicked the right option so how I ended up with still only 1 ticket is beyond me and I know the ticket was cheaper then usual but we booked far in advanced so I assumed it was early bird tickets or something.. again I never used the website so mistakes can happen and to be honest it's not user friendly i book things online all of the time I could imagine this happening a lot. The whole reserving seats thing does not work in the current way, the website is outdated and the ticket machines are ancient.. for the money spent for a ticket new systems should be put in place, like it's much cheaper to go digital but at least make it user friendly before you put these systems out there for the public.. to say I was mortified by the fact that I could have been fined is an understatement.. I did send an email to Irish rail and have heard nothing back it did say 3 working days but I'm guessing they are probably in undated with complaints about their ticket systems.",Written 3 June 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,2 contributions,,1,May 2019 • Solo,Have been Getting the train with Irish rail from Dublin to Galway return each month. It is one of the worst experiences you can possibly deal with. Even though I buy my ticket online and book a seat I am always dealing with people in my seat or asking me to move so they can sit beside friends or whatever. You are paying a lot of money for a service which is so uncomfortable. The biggest problem is Irish rail selling more tickets than they should knowing the amount of seats on the trains. It's one if the most uncomfortable experiences and I'll be better off in future getting gobus or cittlink to save all the needless hassle.

- Decided to upgrade to Business Cabin Seat
- Very nice welcome, a quick service, a lovely breakfast
- Arrived in Cork on-time, relaxed for a good day.

Took the 7am train from Kildare to Cork City, which began with the local train from Kildare to Portlaoise, and then the intercity to Cork.

The Kildare to Portlaoise train was only 2 stops, so quick enough. Then the Intercity to Cork arrived soon after I arrived in Portlaoise. I had to go to the back of the train for the Business cabin. A conductor welcomed me and invited me to my seat, gave me a complimentary business magazine and newspaper and a menu for food.

Then a waitress took my order for breakfast and that was served quite quickly and it was the smaller of the breakfast options, but it was excellent and pretty good value for €10 all in.

The rest of the journey was very smooth, relaxing in the reclining chair, the Wi-Fi could be better, no doubt, but it never ruined my work continuity.

All in I arrived in Cork rested, relaxed, and had a superb day’s work, and then same journey back to Kildare but no Business Cabin on the return train, but still a fine journey home.",Written 17 May 2019,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had a collection reference and getting my ticket was easy; all I had to do was type in my reference. One thing I liked, was unlike in the UK, all the info, including seat reservations, was printed on one ticket rather than a separate ticket for travel and tickets for each reservations. Less clutter and things to lose in your wallet.

On both legs I found my seat easily as my name was on the display above the seat.. I had a table and power socket and there was also free Wi-Fi, which unlike a lot of free Wi-Fi in the UK didn't require you to register first.

The ride was smooth and comfortable and I spent a lovely first leg watching a movie on my laptop and the second listening to music on my phone, (which because they could be plugged in plugged in meant no battery drain), and admiring the lovey Irish scenery.

There was also an at seat trolleys service. All staff I encountered on both services were wonderfully helpful and friendly and the trains were spotlessly clean.

Transfer across Dublin was easy as my ticket included the tram.

,,,,,"Dublin, Ireland",55 contributions,0,Feb 2019 • Couples,"North Americans assume the best way to travel is by road; in Europe the best choice is usually rail, and this holds true, even in Ireland, where trains are not super-fast. Ireland is called ""the Emerald Isle"" but travelling by road, you see a lot of not very attractive houses, and your best chance of seeing the green countryside is from a train. The line from Dublin to Belfast is very attractive.

Attractive too is the Enterprise Express rolling stock, which has first and second class, with a buffet car and trolley service for second class, and in-seat service in first class. As generally in Europe, second class is four seats in the width of the car and three seats in first class. First class seats recline without invading another passenger 's space — if only airlines could manage this...

Trains leave approximately every two hours, and journey time is two and a quarter hours. Most of the track is in the republic, but the Enterprise reaches Dundalk in just 45 minutes, and the remainder of the time is spent clattering through Northern Ireland.

Fortunately, you can order food and beverages and dire the scenery.

Former Belfast Central, now renamed Lanyon Place, is an unattractive station, but actually offers a lot of services, including free onward connections to the city.

Holders of a Social Welfare card travel free, but you need to leave time to fill in a form at the station before travel.

The train service  could benefit from adding healthy sugar free,  wheat free or gluten free treats  and caffeine free beverages e.g herbal teas to the carriage cafe menu. Lots of room for improvement there. If you prefer healthy eating,  bring your own food and drink.

Every experience we had in Dublin was wonderful and we were met with friendly locals every step of the way. The only exception to this is when we went to Heuston Train Station in order to travel to Cork.

The woman at the information counter was shockingly rude and and aggressive. We arrived to the station early and were inquiring if we could take the earlier train to Cork since it still had open seats.

She immediately became angry and showed absolutely no interest in providing any help whatsoever. She said the tickets originally purchased were “non-flexible” and couldn’t be moved. Apparently non-flexible means you also get treated like rubbish. We were willing to pay a fee or buy a new ticket if necessary so that was not the issue for us. The problem was how rude and impatient she was about the entire thing. Irish Rail should employ someone at the information booth who is willing to actually help people and is even remotely friendly.

However after my experience on the 15th of December at Plunkett Station in waterford, I am traumatized. I was doing my end of semester exams where I was attending to stay the weekend however I got an emergency phone call to come home. The train was leaving plunkett station waterford at 13:05 so I left my house with loads of time to spare however, I got stuck in traffic on the bus which was a problem. My boyfriend and I got off the bus and ran for the train station, where my boyfriend ran ahead. We arrived at the train station at 13:03 which I’ve done several times before and was able to get on the train. However they let my boyfriend pass through the gates and wouldn’t allow me saying I was “late”. My boyfriend informed the men at the door that I was on the way and to not lock it. However, all I received was a hostile approach from one arrogant man, who felt the need to lecture me that I was late. I said to the man that it was an emergency and I needed to get home, that I knew I was running late but I wasn’t holding up the trains schedule. He continued to roar at me until it reached 13:05 and told the train to drive on. I have never felt so traumatized in my life. After explaining my needs to get home, I actually cried to the man who wouldn’t let me onto the train I was that upset and stressed,you’d think someone would of helped, but not one bit of compassion from the several workers at the station.

I pre-booked my seat and paid in advance for my seat to be able to travel in ''comfort'' as all your advertisements suggest. Instead I arrived to see yet again a que out of the station. Rather that prioritize those who had pre-booked it was a free for all on the train. People standing for a whole 2 and a half hour journey from Galway to Dublin, surely a health and safety concern for those travelling the whole distance. This was not the most concerning issue. I arrived to my seat to find it occupied by another passager who at first refused to move. After pointing out he eventually let me in. The gentleman in Question was clearly drunk. To make it worse he had soiled himself. So I had the glorious pleasure of sitting beside this gentleman for the next 2+ hours whilst he smells of crap and drinks cans getting more and more drunk...

As someone who works in the Hospitality Industry, I have tried to give Irish Rail the opportunity to rectify the situation. I was offered €18 back from one part of my trip as a voucher to use again. As this is not the first issue I have had with Irish Rail (it is the first major issue) I will not be using their service again and had requested my money back. I have now waited a total of 11 days for an answer to my request of getting my money back, but a whopping 7 weeks for this issue to be resolved.

In general, she was rude, displayed no customer service skills or interest in customer satisfaction & generally let all her colleagues down with her appalling attitude. Perhaps her direct superior should also take note.
However on the 17.20 pm return a most friendly, caring, mannerly girl manned the trolly & was a credit to Irish Rail. Both girls wore name badges but I failed to note their names.

Irish Rail did the trick for most of our recent travel in Ireland -- and saved us lots of cash, too.We actually took another rail line from Belfast to Dublin, but used Irish rail to go from Dublin to Cork and later, from Galway to Dublin.  We also took a commuter line from Cork to Cohb and back.  In all cases, the trains were on time, clean and I loved the online booking option where you could reserve your seats and even have your names listed above them to make it extra easy to find them.  This was an extremely affordable and efficient way to get around Ireland. We also found the train stations easy to negotiate.  One note.  Keep your ticket after using it to board.  We were surprised to find that in some stations, they wanted us to produce the tickets a second time to exit (fortunately, I had not thrown them away!).Free charging stations at the seats for phones was great!Also, at the Heuston Station in Dublin, the taxi stand is not overly well marked.

A male entered the carriage from whom a dreadful odour emanated. After a short time he vomited all over the carriage seat and floor in the opposite seats. This was self induced due to excess alcohol having been consumed. Absolutely horrendous. I asked him to go to the bathroom he didn't but continued vomiting and spitting everywhere. My gripe with Train is I was unable to inform anybody in authority. Dreadful Service having paid a huge amount of money for 2 tickets. We vacated our seats and stood in another carriage for a half hour until seats became available. I did notify a staff member when I alighted at my stop and he dismissed my concerns and needless to say did nothing!!!!!!!

Great way to travel and arrive stress free in Dublin with seemless interchange with the Luas at Heuston and quickly over to our hotel in the city centre. Living in between Cork and Killarney I now find parking the car at the latter is cheaper option for the two or three day trip. Decent on line fare and seat reservation although we have had no difficulty finding seats on board without...wi fi is pretty decent and there are electric points for charging.

I decided to come off the train for health and safety reasons as I came towards the gates and decided to tell the man that there was no seats for me and I wanted to take the next train he told me my ticket does not guarantee me a seat on the train. I told him for health and safety reasons if the train was to crash with me standing up would be detrimental. I told him I had no problem reporting this to the transport agency. He told me I could get the next train to Cork if I wish to do so.

,,,,,1 contribution,,1,Nov 2017 • Business,"I've been using Irish rail for ten years, and the trains, while always messy/stinky, are reasonably on time all things considered.

There must have been some fare evasion at some point, since they started checking tickets as I am getting out of the station. Seems a bit lazy, as I would expect them to actually be in the trains, but that's what they do.

Now today 29th of November 2017, they were there again, checking the tickets just before I go out the station. They always check it, and then immediately tag off the ticket, on the machine, without asking.
So today I asked them if I could please get to tag my own ticket out. I was met with open disdain and an immediate question of ""Why"". So I'm standing there, one customer, having asked a question, that I don't think is rude, and he is there in his uniform, with three extra uniformed guys standing off to the side, laughing/talking to themselves.
I felt very intimidated by this, and was surprised by his tone, I thought I had done nothing wrong.
I stammered that I would like to tag out myself, and then he said ""Doesn't make a fukkin difference ye Culty"" I do not know what Culty means, but his tone didn't make it sound friendly.

I would not choose Irish rail, but there is no choice for my route, so I guess I'll just have to deal with what I guess is casual racism. If they need to check you ticket, just keep your head down and don't say anything to them, I guess they deal with a lot of abuse and they are not above fighting back.",Written 29 November 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,3 contributions,,0,Aug 2017 • Family,Absolutely loved the Irish rail experience today! I was told by someone we could get the train from lucan to bray so we drove to adamstown train station only to be told we can't but the guy behind the desk was very helpful. He told us we can park our car free of charge and get the train to huston and then the tram to Connolly station. We could have drove to bray but decided to experience this. The journey took about 2 hours but was totally worth it! We got to see some beautiful views along the way and everyone we met  (staff) was very helpful and nice 😊😊 ,Written 10 August 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"County Mayo, Ireland","1,568 contributions",1,Aug 2017 • Couples,"I use Irish Rail frequently to Dublin and back. Over the last few years, considerable upgrade work had been done on the tracks and new rolling stock has been put into service. The time of the journey has reduced even though there seems always to be scheduling issues, as the train, while making good time on the new tracks, has an unscheduled 'stop' somewhere along the way, usually in the bogs in the midlands loosing all the time it just made up! It's a shame that better tracks were not laid which would allow the train to travel faster. As it stands now, did you ever notice the amount of 'rocking and rolling' the train does when travelling at speed? Just stand up and try and walk the aisle ways or try and stand in the toilet without been thrown from side to side! I would hate to see the train try and move any faster (even though I would like a shorter trip!) as I think it could easily leave the tracks. I believe Irish Rail should examine this issue. I have never noticed this type of unsteadiness on trains in the U.K. or on the Continent.

On the journey to Dublin I experienced no problems with my choice of ticket.  It was only on our way back ( p.s. train did not leave until 25mins later than shown on either of the tickets or on your website)   that very same day, I was notified of a ""problem"" with my ticket. We were half way home at this point when I felt as If i was being berated and undermined by the man checking our tickets.  I had purchased a STUDENT ticket after much consideration and researching YOUR definition of CHILD ticket.  your child ticket stated that it was for only under 16s. I am currently 16 years (if I have to be 3 months to be exact)  and heading in to my last year of secondary school. The man who checked our tickets came off in an passive aggressive Manor towards myself over my  choice of ticket stating that only COLLEGE students are able to purchase tickets such as mine (even though your website disagrees with your employees statement).  This whole ordeal left me feeling upset and both me and my aunt very annoyed on how this situation was dealt with.

He said hello to every single person with a big smile . But then I saw an African lady walk towards him, his face changed , he saw she had many bags also, to my shock , he turned his back towards my seat and never said hello to her nor did he offer this lady any help at all. He in fact just looked away , to me this is racism and this staff member Joe represents CIE. I've contacted Irish rail on July 5, no reply at all. I contacted ted them again on July 26 and asked why I heard nothing back, they proceeded to ask me of an email they send in receipt of complaints to which I happily forwarded and suddenly they found my complaint so it's always good to click save button.  Ironically, they replied saying they did respond to me on July 15 but when I asked them for this proof, it was the end of hearing from them so they dug a hole for themselves , I received no emails, letters or phone calls so horrible lies and trying to cover themselves.

,,,,,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",7 contributions,0,May 2017 • Couples,"I had pre-booked and paid 37 Euros by internet for two tickets on the Iarnrod Eireann (Irish Rail) from Belfast Central to Dublin Connolly to be sure my wife and I didn't have problems getting on the train because it would be a Saturday. I received an email with 3 different codes to pick up my tickets from the machine in the station, which was already a bit confusing (why not send a single, unmistakable code?).

The day before the trip I went to Belfast Central to pick up the tickets so I already had them with me for the next day. The machines didn't recognize my purchase with neither of the 3 codes, so I asked for help and an employee told me I had to pick them the next day before the trip.

I did so and the result was the same: the machine didn't recognize neither of the codes (which I knew were OK because I had printed them directly from the mail they sent me). So I made the line -which was huge- up to the counter to try to pick up the tickets from there and the employee told me I wasn't on the list of passengers for that train and apparently my code and credit card weren't of any help either.

To make things worse, there was no one else to help me other than the employee on the counter who was selling tickets, so I had to try to solve the problem with dozens of people behind me on the line waiting to purchase their ticket, so I had to make the claim under that pressure.

I ended up giving up on the guy in the counter, freed the line and went to search for help somewhere else, but there was no one else to help me, so the situation got quite despairing. In the end I opted to make the line again and buy new tickets, which costed about 60 Pounds so we didn't lose our train and could go on with our schedule, but it was a stressful experience.

So in the end we ended up sitting where there was room left instead of in the seats we had chosen by internet. The trip in itself was OK as the train is comfortable.

When I got to Dublin I printed the email with the reservations I had made (the ones that failed) and went to Connolly with that and the tickets I had bought at Belfast to make a claim. The guy who took my claim at Connolly was very kind and helpful, he checked that everything was OK with the booking I had made by internet and told me they would refund me the extra money I had to spend (he didn't offer possible explanations as to why the bookings had failed).

So a few days later I received an email from Iarnrod Eireann confirming I had been refunded with... 37 Euros!!! The money of the bookings I had made by internet, instead of the 60 Pounds I had to pay for the tickets at Belfast because their system had failed! So in the end I received less than half the money they should have reimbursed me with.

So my piece of advice for travelers is: resign yourselves to buying the ticket at a more expensive price at the station, as Irish Rail website system is anything but reliable for bookings.",Written 20 June 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

On a recent vacation trip to Ireland I made sure to structure things so I could make at least part of the trip by train and I was not disappointed. In my case we were based in Dublin and made one day-trip to Waterford with a stop off at Kilkenny on the way back and another day-trip to Cork. We bought tickets at Heuston Station, just walk-up, each day. Normal fare, not premium or first class. All the cars were clean. All the bathrooms on the trains were clean. Our mid-week trips were not crowded and my friend and I had a four-top table to ourselves every leg of the trip. Every table had two power outlets so we could recharge phones or whatever. The on-board wi-fi varied from just fine (four legs) to not working at all (one leg). Note that you are limited to 400MB quota on any one trip. The trains maxed out at 100 mph but spent most of their time slower than that. The ride was perfectly acceptable but not super-smooth like a Japanse Shinkansen or a Korean KTC. It was better than US Amtrak except Acela. The snack-service trolley made at least one pass on each leg. We were told that you could make a stopover on the way back from a destination on the same ticket (all on one day) and that worked fine (e.g. we stopped at Kilkenny on the way back from Waterford and then continued on a different train to Dublin). We got lots of lovely views of the countryside on our trips. If you like trains, recommended.

However, the service on the return from Belfast to Dublin was the opposite, which is way I'm rating it this high. One, sometimes two attendants were constantly in the first class cabin taking meal orders, etc. In all, a fairly inexpensive and comfortable way to travel to Belfast and back to Dublin. BTW, the station in Belfast was directly across the Hilton and pretty much located in the City Center, with easy access to the Titanic Museum. The train station in Belfast is not quite as convenient, so I opted for take a taxi there and then back to the hotel because I had luggage.

The online booking system was fine but thankfully it has now been updated and upgraded which makes it much user friendly. The seat reservation is also a bonus when you purchase on-line and it was great to have the peace of mind to have a reserved seat waiting for you.

The trains were always on-time departing on the occasions that I travelled which makes it good for planning and getting to your destination as planned.

The trains were really clean and tidy on the journeys and everything was as you would expect it to be.

One disappointing aspect of our trip to Cork was that there was no trolley service on the train ‘due to the train being busy’, which I would have expected it to be. The trolley service was advertised on-line when booking, but unfortunately on the day, it wasn’t available. There was a full food and beverage service available, except you just had to go to the dining car to purchase it.

The staff along the way were always friendly and courteous and they interacted well with a number of the travelers.

Although the prices were a little expensive, I would highly recommend train travel as opposed to taking the bus.

Big tip.... if you are going somewhere and returning a few days later and don't want to buy the seven day pass, do not buy two one ways as this is money. Instead buy an open end return ticket which is good on same routing for a month.
This option is a bit harder to find in the kiosk. Just select buy ticket and then go to the return screen and then you. An buy the open ended ticket from there. (I didn't see it on main menu). A local showed me and it was a big difference in fare vs buying two one way tickets.

I wonder is it that Irish Rails cost suddenly spiralled by 40% plus? What's the justification? Because airlines do it? That's no reason - Irish Rail writes its own rules as does any monopoly and therefore they can decide to act in a customer centred way ....should they wish!

Easy to purchase tickets for the 11:25 am train at the kiosk inside the Heuston Station. We are a group of 4 adults traveling with 6 suitcases and 4 backpacks. Plenty of room for us and for all the luggage both overhead and in the compartments at the entry to the train car. Nice bathrooms and snacks served at our seats from a pushcart. The train was on time and the announcements were easy to understand on the loudspeaker. This is our first time traveling through Ireland and we had no troubles whatsoever riding the train.

Travelling by train is a pleasure yet I've booked tickets to New Zealand quicker and easier than using your website. Why do you need me to have an account to book a train ticket? Airline companies don't demand this! All you need is a phone number/email address that you can send in a reservation number to. Also booking Sail and rail tickets should be available online as they are in the U.K. side. You can also visit any train station in the U.K. and buy a sail /rail ticket to say killarney or cork and immediately get a ticket printed out for you. In Ireland they look at you and huff and then proceed to hand write a ticket.,Written 15 January 2017,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The member of staff said it would be cleaned. However the worker that came on board merely looked in the door of the toilets in each carriage and did not clean them. Disgraceful behaviour.

The package included 2 nights in Kilarney and 2 nights in Galway with entry tickets to Blarney Castle, the cliffs, Kylemore Abbey, etc. This trip does consist of some long days beginning at 07:00 and only ending at 18:30.
My wife and I truly enjoyed the tour but it is very dependent on the tour guide provided for the day tours. We were very fortunate to have an eloquent and knowledged guide for day 2 to 4(Jonathon) a satisfactory guide for day 5 (Lolly Tours) and a quiet spoken repetitive guide for day 1.
The hotels provided were quite satisfactory and for days 1 - 4 the pick-up at the hotel was efficient. Day 5 was a little annoying as we were on our own to walk 6 blocks with our bags to the train station and then we had to leave them in a locked room until departure time.
Overall, we saw all of the points of interest that were on our list, fell in love with the Ring of Kerry and Conemara (Kylemore) but found the tour to the Cliffs of Mohr's and the ride to Galway too long.",Written 23 September 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We worked out a cost comparison of renting a car for four days versus taking the Irish Rail + taxis + a full day tour to Dingle (Dublin airport Uber to Hueston en route to Galway, local Killarney taxis to B&B and up to Tralee, a full day tour out to Dingle with Mór Active Tours in Kilarney)... and it netted out to be the same amount! Everything worked with our schedules, too, such that taking the trains took only a little more time (or the same amount of time) as driving would have taken. Plus, no traffic jams!

We loved that Irish Rail offered free and reliable wi-fi on all but one train, coffee and bar service, snacks on the longer hauls (Dublin to Galway), and we had no troubles on the smaller train connections (EG Galway to Killarney by way of Ennis/Shannon). All of our trains were on time the entire trip, and connections were a breeze (even with flooding over the rail outside of Ennis! Irish Rail put the whole train on a bus to the connecting station and we remained right on time).

If ever in doubt about which platform or train we needed to be on, we asked a friendly fellow passenger. Lots of locals take the train for bank holidays and to visit family, travel for work. All sign boards and announcements were spoken/printed in both English and Gaelic.

Train cars were tidy and comfortable – the larger trains allowed you to reserve seats in advance, and you could have seats facing one another with a table in between the seats to do work or have a meal.

One big bonus: The rail lines were built a century ago, so the great majority of our travel was spent looking at the beautiful Irish countryside – paddocks of sheep and horses and ancient castles – instead of looking at a freeway. There are also bathrooms on board!

We had the printed out tickets from online, but needed the paper tickets from the station. We missed this step, but with documentation and some explanation to the conductor (train had left the station), all was ok. Our hotel told us that the station was unattended and to proceed with just the print out of our online tickets.

Staff very helpful, comfortable. Seats very comfortable. Recommend bring snacks. Our trip from Rosslare was about 4 hours.

Would have been nice to have the procedure for online tickets with big signs posted at the station for foreigners like us who haven't used the train there before! seating areas comfortable and free Internet was great. We had our suitcases and bags with us, and was no problem. Luggage racks available, accessible and convenient.

At the terminal, you pay or show your online receipt. We got on the train, then later, the conductor asked for the paper tickets, as above. The train stations were clean, well marked and we easily navigated once in the system. Taxis were waiting outside the station to take us to the airport to pick up our rental car!

Hard to get a rental car from England to Ireland Republic. We left our rental car at Europcar in Wales, took a taxi to the nearby terminal. One in Ireland, we took the train to Dublin to get another rental car. Couldn't find a rental car to pick up at the ferry and then return to the Dublin airport at the end of the trip! Taking the Irish rail to Dublin to collect the rental car was a good experience anyway! :)",Written 3 June 2016,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Initially he was absolutely rude and unhelpful; tried to imply it was our own fault and that he could do nothing. With pleasant but persistent dissatisfaction from all of us, Robbie eventually placed us in first class where we had a fantastic time! Lovely first class carriage with great service, and yes Robbie came through in the end, but the disorganisation of not labelling tables and the subsequent apathy and arrogance of the train manager aren't acceptable.

Staff was very friendly.  Tickets were easy to purchase on line and then used the kiosk to print our tickets at the station in Westport.  The ride itself was really smooth and was very comfortable.  We had a table with 4 seats.  Views along the trip was amazing!  It was really nice to sit back and enjoy the country side.  There was a food and beverage cart that was pushed from car to car.  It had a variety of snacks and beverages.  Only came around once during our trip so if you're really hungry buy enough for the whole ride when the cart comes around the first time.  Free WIFI service was provided.  A really great experience and got us to Dublin in time.  Taxi service was available once we got to Dublin and was  short ride to all the attractions and hotels.

You ride out to the starting point then travel via coach and train to various sites. The rail travel was great, nice and smooth--you get to see all of the scenery along the way--amazing all the cows they have wandering around the countryside, freely grazing. Blarney Castle is more special than we imagined--castle itself is great--it's a climb up to the Blarney Stone, but worth it if you don't mind some narrow windy stone steps. Ring of Kerry is a special natural treat--you see bigger mountains than you'd expect on your left and bays/the ocean on your right. And the Cliffs of Moher are spectacular. They fill the days with other worthwhile sites (the sheep dog guy on the Cliffs of Moher day was great). All very well done. Our guide was great.
Interesting note--you can piece these tours together in different ways--they have trips leaving for different day trips everyday and you can connect with other trips at various points along the way--we had some people doing just one day, some going for more days, some who joined us on the second or third day who might be going for any length after that. Interesting and different--more good than bad, just a little unusual.
Here's a tip. We did this the day after we arrived in Dublin--mistake--you start bright and early (7:00) and you have to get there early and train station is a ride from downtown. Do it after settling in, seeing Dublin and checking out the Guinness tour (a pure can't miss right there).",Written 28 September 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I can only describe the scene as manic and totally chaotic as we boarded in Heuston. The digital displays that usually indicates which carriage you are in were not in order so no-one new which carriage they were in and couldn't find their booked seats.
Once we eventually got seated, there was a lengthy wait(over half way through the two and a half hour journey) before the food cart got to our carriage. Now starving by this time we were forced to order a ham and cheese sandwich(as there was nothing else left), a couple of danishes and two cups of tea. We were then told my the very stressed looking attendant that as the wifi was not working he could not accept a card for payment. He removed the food he had served us and put it back on the cart. The passenger sitting next to us ended up giving us the change we were short so that we could at least get the sandwich to share.

Up until January 2014, my only exposure to Irish Rail had been the odd trip from Cork to Cobh, where the commuter rail line is quite frankly the most direct option. Since January, I've gotten some experience with Irish Rail's long distance service, mostly on the Cork-Dublin Heuston line, which I've taken five times so far, plus an additional roundtrip on the Line from Dublin Connolly to Sligo.
Basically, Irish Rail's long distance services are served by two types of equipment. The Cork-Heuston line is mainly served by locomotive pulled trains consisting of what are known as Mk.IV coaches. These 8 car trains have both Second and first Class coaches, as well as a dedicated restaurant car. While they are older than the other long distance trains, they are still what I would consider the ""flagship trains"". Like all Irish Rail trains, there is free WiFi throughout the train, though the Mk. IV coaches do not have charge points for laptop chargers, etc. Please note that the Windows of the Mk. IV coaches have a distinctive blue tint which can make the outside appear cooler and darker than it really is.
All other long distance routes out of both Dublin Heuston and Dublin Connolly, with the exception of the cross border Enterprise service to Belfast, are served by InterCity Railcars. These are multiple units of between three and six cars, which can be coupled together. Not all Railcar units have a dedicated first class section or an onboard restaurant/bistro car. On these services, there will most likely be an onboard trolley service selling snacks & drinks. Free Wifi is available on these trains as well, and charge points are available throughout the train. The power packs for the ICR trains are underneath the floor of the trains, so you can expect the noise level in these trains to be higher than on the locomotive-hauled trains.
I've racked up quite a significant number of miles on trains in my life, from suburban services in the Greater London Area to the great high speed trains of France, Austria, and Germany. While Irish Rail is certainly no match for a TGV Duplex or an Austrian Railways Railjet, it does compare very favourably with regular long range trains on the continent. When it comes to cross-country travel within Ireland, they've become my option of choice whenever possible.",Written 25 June 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"Surrey, Canada",83 contributions,1,Jun 2015 • Business,"There's a reason why passengers wait to flood the platform way before the train is due to leave. I realized on my first trip with irish rail that it's because they overbook their trains. People ended up standing for long legs of the trip from dublin to belfast. Luckily I pre-booked my seats online..so I had to ask the two people who were in my seats to move, which they did begrudgingly. The food/drinks are also overpriced. Next time, I'll pass on the rail and will opt for travel by coach. ",Written 16 June 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,missouri,114 contributions,0,May 2015 • Friends,"After reading many reviews and suggestions regarding car rentals and the need for a car while touring Ireland we decided against the idea and traveled using public transportation.  This was not my first trip; but it was my daughter's.  My first trip was five years ago; don't ask me why it took me so long to return! I don't know!  That trip was a formal tour with CIE and was an overall very good experience.  But my daughter was studying Gaelic and wanted a more 'natural' experience  and so did I.  We flew into Shannon; I had reserved a Silverbus pick up but I made the reservation incorrectly online.  Instead of booking my arrival date I booked my travel date which was one day earlier.  Funny, when I rent to airport information (after discovering my error when no one showed up) the info agent said ""oh, so you're the American from yesterday!""  So we taxied to Ennis and spent a wonderful night.  I'll have to do a separate review for all the fabulous restaurants/accommodations we had.)  We walked to the bus depot and took a bus to Galway.  Great way to travel with wifi and the driver was great.  Luggage storage was no issue.  Arrived on time and walked to our B&B.  After two glorious days of sights we walked to the train station and traveled to Dublin.  Clean trains, polite people, book online ahead of time for discount and you will find your seat with your name above it.  No need for first class seating.  wifi again was good.  Nice views and an easy way to get to Dublin; I'd do it again in a heartbeat.",Written 11 June 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"Dublin, Ireland",30 contributions,0,Apr 2015 • Solo,"Can someone explain to me why Irish rail offers no option other a phone line to contact customer service on their website? Can some one explain to me why the trains are so filthy, particularly the toilet facilities? Can someone explain to me the legislative basis for the obligation to REGISTER with Irish rail to buy tickets???? Why the need to give so much personal information??  and why, when one goes to book a seat, there is no indication as to which direction the carriages are arranged to travel in order to facilitate choice of seat - Seriously, who is the idiot running this company and why are the Irish people so complacent.... Utterly dreadful - awful - it represents everything I hate about Ireland -",Written 12 April 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

,,,,,"Dublin, Ireland",8 contributions,1,Feb 2015 • Solo,"I was a passenger on the 18-15 Heuston to Claremorris train on Friday 13th of February. Due to the train being over booked passengers had to sit on the floor in & between the carriages. Despite people having booked seats no names were up on the display. Probably because the seat had been sold twice? I sat on one such seat only to be told by a 20 year old tourist that it was her seat. I apologised & moved. She was bewildered that anyone would take a seat that was not on their ticket. Obviously public transport abroad is better than here. Another tourist asked a passenger to move only to be curtly informed that he (the seated) had paid for a seat & would only relinquish the seat when another could be found for him.

Realising that floor space was my only option I made for a spot inside one of the doors. What I found was a dirty floor that had seen heavy foot traffic, soiled wheelie suitcases and no floor cleaner in the last month.

Others weren't so lucky they had to stand with one older man declaring he couldn't sit down as he wouldn't be able to get up again unaided. One lady sat on the connecting part between the two carriages and proceeded to turn 50 shades of green.

The train swayed & rocked but not in a good way. It was no gentle lulling it was stomach churning rocking that made you rue eating breakfast & lunch. Add that to sitting on a floor near a public toilet and you understand the disgusting regard Irish Rail have for their customers. I listened to other passengers bitterly complain & declare they would write letters of complaint.

To add insult to injury a girl came along pulling a trolley of over priced snacks. Her arrival packed us closer together as she had to get by. The food was not a compensation for our discomfort. I was even surprised she offered to sell drinks. The only thing worse than sitting on a dirty floor beside a toilet was the thought of being scaled by an over priced tea. Also how many people would I have to move to get to an over stuffed bin?

Is it seen as perfectly acceptable to be on a train going over 100km/hour sitting on a floor being tossed like a salad between two carriages. If you take a bus you get a seat belt if you take the train you are lucky to get a seat even after spending 53-65 Euro. You are herded onto a train no concern for safety, but hey you can buy a cup of scalding liquid whilst you sit on the floor being rocked in a nauseating way.

So if visiting Ireland & heading West which I think every visitor should do I advise hire a car get a bus either guided tour or public. Enjoy the trip just do not rely on the train. Did I mention the train could't even make it on time?",Written 15 February 2015,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
