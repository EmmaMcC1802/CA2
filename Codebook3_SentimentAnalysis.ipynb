    "# Sentiment Analysis of Ireland's Transport Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I used `Octoparse` `(Version 8.6.7)` to scrape two webpages to garner reviews to assess public opinion of Ireland's national rail service, **Iarnród Éireann (AKA Irish Rail)**. Octoparse is a programme used for high-speed web scraping with no coding required, and has customisable workflows and a helper wizard tool to assist in the task. This option was chosen for the sake of time efficiency. The webpages scraped were the following:\n",
    "* [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g186605-d7940415-Reviews-Irish_Rail-Dublin_County_Dublin.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This website was chosen as some social media websites (e.g. X, Meta) block web-scraping, either by making it very difficult or by hiding it behind a paywall. The scraped data were downloaded as .csv files. Another advantage of using Octoparse is that it automatically removes duplicates. The downside to Octoparse is that it's a paid service. The data used in this sentiment analysis was collected using the free trial.\n",
